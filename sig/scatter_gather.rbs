# Scatter-Gather Pattern for ActiveJob
# 
# This module provides a scatter-gather pattern for coordinating job execution.
# Jobs can wait for other jobs to complete before executing, with configurable
# polling, retry, and timeout behavior.
# 
# Example workflow:
#   # Start some scatter jobs
#   email_parser_job = EmailParserJob.perform_later(email_id: 123)
#   attachment_processor_job = AttachmentProcessorJob.perform_later(email_id: 123)
#   ai_categorizer_job = AICategorizerJob.perform_later(email_id: 123)
# 
#   # Create a gather job that waits for all dependencies to complete
#   NotifyCompleteJob.gather(email_parser_job, attachment_processor_job, ai_categorizer_job).perform_later
# 
# The gather job will:
# - Check if all dependencies are complete
# - If complete: enqueue the target job immediately
# - If not complete: poll every 2 seconds (configurable), re-enqueuing itself
# - After 10 attempts (configurable): discard with error reporting
# 
# Configuration options:
#   - max_attempts: Number of polling attempts before giving up (default: 10)
#   - poll_interval: Time between polling attempts (default: 2.seconds)
# 
# Example with custom configuration:
#   TouchingJob.gather(jobs, poll_interval: 0.2.seconds, max_attempts: 4).perform_later(final_path)
